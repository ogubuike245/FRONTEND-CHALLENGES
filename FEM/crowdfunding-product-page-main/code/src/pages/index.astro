					<h1>About this project</h1>

					<p>
						The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and
						stylish platform that elevates your screen to a more
						comfortable viewing height. Placing your monitor at eye
						level has the potential to improve your posture and make
						you more comfortable while at work, helping you stay
						focused on the task at hand.
					</p>
					<p>
						Featuring artisan craftsmanship, the simplicity of
						design creates extra desk space below your computer to
						allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks to be stored under
						the stand.
